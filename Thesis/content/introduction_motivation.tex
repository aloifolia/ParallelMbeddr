\chapter{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item mbeddr is a language and ide for embedded programming that facilitates programming by providing higher level language mechanisms
\item parallel programming is becoming ever more important
\item yet, mbeddr is still lacking higher-level support for parallel programming
\item compared to library extensions language based support for pp features multiple benefits: individual problem-specific syntax, reduction of erroneous input by type system enhancements, program-wide optimization of generated code
\item short examples for benefits
\item ParallelMbeddr introduces task-based explicit parallel programming with shared memory that can be synchronized
\item Objectives: apropriate syntax, type system support for safer code, optimized output
\item outline of the work
\item andeutung der ergebnisse (bezug nehmen in conclusion)
\end{itemize}
