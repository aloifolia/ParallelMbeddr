\chapter{Design and Translation}
In this chapter the extension of mbeddr for parallel programming, called ParallelMbeddr, is introduced. To this end the new language features for C are explained each in terms of the design and the translation to plain mbeddr C code\footnote{For the sake of legibility the syntax of the generated mbeddr code is depicted in a simplified manner where it is deemed necessary.}. In order to illustrate the presented features a running example is incrementally built. Further examples are depicted whenever the running example does not provide the right structure to clarify a feature. At the end of this chapter the implemented measures to make the extension sufficiently safe are explained.
