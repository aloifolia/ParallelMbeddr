\chapter{Design and Implementation}
In this chapter extension of mbeddr for parallel programming, called ParallelMbeddr, is introduced. To this end the new language features for C are explained each in terms of the design and the translation to plain mbeddr C code. In order to illustrate the presented features a running example is incrementally built. Further examples are depicted whenever the running example does not provide the right structure to clarify a feature.
Whenever necessary relevant details of the implementation in mbeddr are briefly depicted.
