Multiprocessing is becoming steadily more important for raising the performance of computers. Parallel programming is the key to leveraging such increased processing power. However, parallelization impedes the reasoning about side-effects of application code, which may cause data-races and, thus, non-deterministic behavior. Synchronization via locks is one measure to overcome this menace, by serializing conflicting parallel memory accesses. However, it can also impair an application's run-time significantly. This thesis shows how mbeddr's first-class language extension support and IDE integration can be used to partially overcome these issues. The new language abstraction, ParallelMbeddr, offers convenient-to-use concepts for explicit parallelization. It provides a thread-safe communication approach by using the typesystem to prevent low-level data-races. Furthermore, it uses the compiler integration to prototypically optimize the generated code in terms of synchronization overhead. The evaluation indicates that these goals are accomplished, although much potential for improvements and enhancements remains.
