\section{Notation}
In the following sections the concepts of the language of mbeddr are iteratively extended with new elements. For this purpose based on the notation presented by Pierce\cite{TypesAndProgrammingLanguages} the syntax of new concepts is described by notations like:
\begin{ccode}
e ::= ...| e'
\end{ccode}
This exemplary line means that the set of expressions of mbeddr is extended with the expression \CODE{e'} which may contain arbitrary metavariables like \CODE{e}. In order to fit into the type system of mbeddr these concepts are equipped with \textit{type inference} rules which each, given a list of premises, derive the type of some concept in the conclusion:
\begin{align*}
\inference*[NewConcept]{\mathit{premise_1}, ..., \mathit{premise_n}}{\qquad\quad e' |- t' \qquad\quad} 
\end{align*}
The premises of the concepts are kept minimal but not exhaustive which means that complex premises are given as informal explanations and are mostly explained in section \ref{safetyMeasures}. This way the type inference rules are kept comprehensible and the explanations for the safety-measures of ParallelMbeddr are kept closely together. Additionally this seperation resembles MPS' seperation of type inference rules and non-typesystem rules.

The translation of a new concept in ParallelMbeddr to a base concept of mbeddr will be shown informally by listing the resulting code that is generated by the IDE given some input code. To this end at times the symbol $\Longrightarrow$ will denote the translation of code $c_1$ to some other code $c_2$ in $c_1 \Longrightarrow c_2$. The translation of basic code will often entail the generation of additional code somewhere else in the program as a side effect, e.g. the translation of an expression to a function call may force the generator of mbeddr to generate the declaration of the called function first. These side effects will also be demonstrated by listings of the generated code.
